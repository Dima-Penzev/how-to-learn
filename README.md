# How to learn
**About**

The "How to learn" project was created as a collection of teaching methods. As all people are different, the information they receive is remembered in different ways. Therefore, this project helps everyone to choose for themselves the teaching method that would be effective for them, which would help, in turn, to avoid loss of interest in learning. The project contains statistical data concerning the education and work of the human brain, principles of learning, video recordings, as well as references to literature and other useful resources containing teaching techniques.

**Technologies used in the project:**

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Flexbox templates
 - BEM
 
 In this project, I honed my initial layout skills. The "How to learn" project has been completed and will not be updated.
